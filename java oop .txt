An object is  a real world entity with a physical or conceptual existence
        > they hold data(attributes) eg. name, age ,height
        and can perform actions (methods) eat() walk()
   they are reference data types

   class is a blueprint of an object

in creating classes in java we use PascalNamingConvention i.e.the first letter of  every name should be in   capital letters
unlike in methods that use camelNamingConvention where every  first letter of every word is in caps  except for the first word

constructors=> special method to initialize objects
                you can pass arguments to a s=constructor and set up initial values
                its automatically called when you create a new object

overloaded constructors  => allow a class to have  multiple constructors  with
different parameter list. they enable objects to be initialized in various ways(more like overloaded methods)

you can create an array of java objects ...
        the data type of the  objects arrays is the class name
        e.g.
                Car [] cars=new Car[3] for wsn empty array

                Car[]cars1={
                new Car("Bentley","Red"),
                new Car("Ferrari","blue"),
                new Car("Mercedes","black")
                }; for anonymous objects

                 Car[] cars={car1,car2,car3}; for instantiated objects

Static key word =>makes a method belong to the class rather than to any other specific object
                   commonly used for utility or shared resources
                   to access a static variable it's best to get use the class instead of the object name
                   good practice=>System.out.println(Friend.penfriends);
                   not good=>System.out.println(friend1.penfriends);
                   you don't need  this  key word when working with a static variable

inheritance=> one class inherit=s the attributes and methods from another class
        child<- parent; child class inherits traits of the parent
        in order for a class inherit the all the attributes and methods use the extends key word  followed by the parent class
        eg public cass Dog extends Animals
        each child class can have it own methods and attributes
    multi-level inheritance=>
                        where a child inherits from the grandparents

Super => it's a keyword that referees to the parents class(subclass<- superclass) used in constructors and methods
        overriding
        calls the parent constructor  to initialize attributes
Method overriding =>
                    when a subclass provides its own  implementation  of  a method that is already defined
                    it allows for cod e reusability and gives specific implementation
                    @Override annotation helps identify the method  has been override it's good practise for  developers

.toString() method=>    inherited from  the object class.it is used to return a string representation of an object
                        by default it returns  a hash code  as a unique identifier
                        it can be used to return a string representation of an object
                        it can be overridden  to provide meaningful details

Abstraction => used to define abstract classes and methods
            it's the process of  hiding  implementation  details  ands showing only esential  features
            abstract classes CAN'T  be instantiated  directly
            we make classes and methods abstract by using abstract keywords
            they can contain 'abstract ' methods (which must be implemented) thus ensuring consistency among children class
            can contain 'concrete' methods (which are inherited)
          unlike abstract methods the concrete methods are defined and inherited within the abstract classes
Interface => A blueprint for a class that specifies  a set  of abstract  methods
               that implementing  classes MUST define.
               It supports  multiple inheritance -like behaviour
               ond major difference btn interfaces and classes is that you can implement more than one interface
               eg: public class Fish implements Prey, Predator {
                @Override
                   public void flee(){
                       System.out.println("The fish is Swimming away");
                   }

                   @Override
                   public void hunt() {
                       System.out.println("The fish is swimming towards its prey");
                   }
                    }
Polymorphism    IT IS A GREEK WORD

                "Poly "= many
                "Morph"=shape
                 objects can identify as other .objects can be  treated as objects od=f common superclass
                can also be achieved using interfaces
                i) dynamic polymorphism/Runtime polymorphism
                    =>when the method that gets executed is decided at  runtime based on actual type of the object

Getters and Setters =>
                  they help protect  object data and add rules  for accessing  or modifying them.
                  GETTERS= methods that make a field READABLE
                  SETTERS = methods that make a field WRITEABLE
                  achieved through declaring the  attributes of the class with a private access modifier
                  for getters = getAtributename
                                eg getModel(){

                                }
                                void setColor(String color){
                                    this.color=color;
                                }
                                if you don't want the  attribute to be writeable we use the  final keyword
Aggregation => represents a "has-a" relationship between objects
                one object contain another object as a part  of its structure , but the contained object/s can exist
                 independently

Composition =>represents a "part of" relationship between objects .
                For example , an engine is "part of " a car
                it allows complex objects to be constructed  from smaller objects
Wrapper classes = they allow primitive values (int char double boolean) to be used  as objects .
                    we "rap them inn an object"
                    Generally, don't Wrap primitives unless you need an object
                    it allows use of Collections and static utility
                   Integer a =new Integer(123)
                                     Double b = new Double(3.14)
                                     Boolean d=new Boolean(true);
                                     Character c=new Character ('%');

                                     however the above method is a n old one
                                     this is a new one;it's called auto boxing

                                       Integer a =123
                                       Double b =3.14
                                       Boolean d=true
                                       Character c='%'
                                       String  e ="pizza"

                                       unboxing
