An object is  a real world entity with a physical or conceptual existence
        > they hold data(attributes) eg. name, age ,height
        and can perform actions (methods) eat() walk()
   they are reference data types

   class is a blueprint of an object

in creating classes in java we use PascalNamingConvention i.e.the first letter of  every name should be in   capital letters
unlike in methods that use camelNamingConvention where every  first letter of every word is in caps  except for the first word

constructors=> special method to initialize objects
                you can pass arguments to a s=constructor and set up initial values
                its automatically called when you create a new object

overloaded constructors  => allow a class to have  multiple constructors  with
different parameter list. they enable objects to be initialized in various ways(more like overloaded methods)

you can create an array of java objects ...
        the data type of the  objects arrays is the class name
        e.g.
                Car [] cars=new Car[3] for wsn empty array

                Car[]cars1={
                new Car("Bentley","Red"),
                new Car("Ferrari","blue"),
                new Car("Mercedes","black")
                }; for anonymous objects

                 Car[] cars={car1,car2,car3}; for instantiated objects

Static key word =>makes a method belong to the class rather than to any other specific object
                   commonly used for utility or shared resources
                   to access a static variable it's best to get use the class instead of the object name
                   good practice=>System.out.println(Friend.penfriends);
                   not good=>System.out.println(friend1.penfriends);
                   you don't need  this  key word when working with a static variable

inheritance=> one class inherit=s the attributes and methods from another class
        child<- parent; child class inherits traits of the parent
        in order for a class inherit the all the attributes and methods use the extends key word  followed by the parent class
        eg public cass Dog extends Animals
        each child class can have it own methods and attributes
    multi-level inheritance=>
                        where a child inherits from the grandparents

Super => it's a keyword that referees to the parents class(subclass<- superclass) used in constructors and methods
        overriding
        calls the parent constructor  to initialize attributes
