An object is  a real world entity with a physical or conceptual existence
        > they hold data(attributes) eg. name, age ,height
        and can perform actions (methods) eat() walk()
   they are reference data types

   class is a blueprint of an object

in creating classes in java we use PascalNamingConvention i.e.the first letter of  every name should be in   capital letters
unlike in methods that use camelNamingConvention where every  first letter of every word is in caps  except for the first word
